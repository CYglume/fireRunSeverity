# FireRuns post fire analysis project

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This project aims to analyse the post fire effects and relate the influence of fire run speed to environmental change. The process comprises two parts of algorithms. In `Data Preparation` we produce fire runs using algorithms from [AndreaDuane/FireRuns](https://github.com/AndreaDuane/FireRuns). But we will use the modified version [Runs2](R/fun/Runs_AllArrows.r) to compare the fire runs in a wider range.

For severity analysis, the `severityCalc` algorithm calls the Google Earth Engine API with Python, and stores the output maps on the Google drive. For `driveDownload` algorithm, the output maps will be downloaded from the Google drive of the same account.

Later in the `Data Analysis`, fire runs were used to retrieve the severity pixels on corresponding places, for the comparison with the other pixels random sampled on the fire perimeter at the same timing.

## Installation

You can install the development version of FireRuns like so:

``` {r}
# devtools::install_github("AndreaDuane/FireRuns")
```

## Example

`area_process()` will look into the data folder named with `"GIF14_Au"` to process the fire run calculation. This uses the original version of algorithm from [AndreaDuane/FireRuns](https://github.com/AndreaDuane/FireRuns), which calculates one max run per `FeHo` selected regardless of the amount of polygons included at a time. The results are like the following:

```{r example-maxRun, message=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
area_process("GIF14_Au", do_plot = T)
```

The function considers the column `OBJECTID` as unique polygon ID while `FeHo` as unique timing for calculating fire runs. Therefore you can 
1. modify the data input to select the column with unique values and correct date time information 
or
2. change the argument in `area_process()` or `area_process_allArrow()` as following:

```{r}
# area_process("GIF14_Au", nameID_i = "OBJECTID", nameFeho_i = "FeHo")
# area_process_allArrow("GIF14_Au", nameID_i = "OBJECTID", nameFeho_i = "FeHo")
```


`area_process_allArrow()` outputs max runs in all polygons instead of only one max run in one polygon per `FeHo` selected. This version uses the modified algorithm [`Runs2()`](R/fun/Runs_AllArrows.r) in this project. Therefore the analysis can be conducted on each polygon with valid max fire run.

```{r example-allRun, message=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
area_process_allArrow("GIF14_Au", do_plot = T)
```
